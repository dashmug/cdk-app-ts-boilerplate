# CDK App Typescript Boilerplate

This is an opinionated boilerplate I use when building [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) applications.

For building open-source constructs, I recommend using [`projen`](https://github.com/projen/projen)'s `awscdk-construct` project type.

## Features

- Latest (best-effort) versions of dependencies
- Package management using `yarn`
- Strict Typescript config (using [`@tsconfig/node18-strictest`](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases#node-18--strictest-tsconfigjson))
- Auto-formatting via `prettier`
- Strict(ish) linting rules enforced by `eslint`
- Standard unit testing setup using `jest`
- Git hooks via `husky` and `link-staged`
- Standard commit messages using `commitlint`
- `shellcheck` for checking shell scripts
- For VSCode users:
  - Recommended extensions
  - Pre-configured settings and launch configurations for debugging
- For Linux/Mac users:
  - `Makefile` with pre-configured commands for convenience
- For Github:
  - Built-in dependabot config
  - Built-in Github Actions workflows for pull requests and `main` branch
  - Scanning for cloud infrastructure misconfigurations via `checkov`
- CDK-specific:
  - Use of project-installed `cdk` instead of a globally-installed one
  - Use `BaseStack` instead of CDK's own `Stack` class to get some
    standard resource-tagging in place
  - Use of `cdk-nag` to statically check if best practices are followed

## Requirements

- Node 18+
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) package manager

## Git Hooks

A few git hooks are set up during the project setup process (`yarn install`).

1. A `pre-commit` hook that runs some checks depending on the staged
   files. The hook itself is found at `.husky/pre-commit`.
2. A `commit-msg` hook that checks whether the commit message conforms to
   the `commitlint` spec. Allowed commit "types" are found in
   `commitlint.config.js`.
